# linux-shell
This project is part of COMP3659 - Operating Systems and involves creating a basic shell for Linux, referred to as mysh. The goal is to develop a command-line interface (CLI) that provides a subset of the functionality found in popular Linux shells such as bash. The shell should support the execution of Linux commands, process handling, input/output redirection, and basic inter-process communication (IPC).
